Magic Folder user interface design
==================================

Scope
-----

In this Objective we will write the design document for how users can conveniently
and securely indicate which folders on some devices should be magically linked to
which folders on other devices.

This is a critical usability and security issue for which there is no known perfect
solution, but which will hopefully be amenable to a "good enough" trade-off solution.
This document explains the design and justifies its trade-offs in terms of security,
usability, and time-to-market.

Tickets on the Tahoe-LAFS trac with the `otf-magic-folder-objective6`_
keyword are within the scope of the user interface design.
