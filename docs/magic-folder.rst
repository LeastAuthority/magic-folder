Usage
=====

Magic-Folder is used in two ways.
To interact with configuration,
the ``magic-folder`` command line tool is used.
For details of this, see the `configuration`_ documentation.
For additional information see our :doc:`Magic-Folder CLI design documentation<../proposed/magic-folder/user-interface-design>`.

To interact with content,
use your normal filesystem-based tools.
The folder which Magic-Folder synchronizes is a normal folder in the filesystem.
The platform's filesystem change notification features are used to detect changes.
